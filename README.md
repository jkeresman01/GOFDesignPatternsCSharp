## Patterns

### Abstract Factory
> [!NOTE]
> Provide an interface for creating families of related dependant objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Adapter
> [!NOTE]
> Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Bridge
> [!NOTE]
> Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that two can vary independently.

### Builder
> [!NOTE]
> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### Chain of Responsibility
> [!NOTE]
> Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

### Command
> [!NOTE]
> Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### Composite
> [!NOTE]
> Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Decorator
> [!NOTE]
> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Facade
> [!NOTE]
> Provide unified interface to a set of interfaces in subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

### Factory Method
> [!NOTE]
> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Flyweight
> [!NOTE]
> Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

### Interpreter
> [!NOTE]
> Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

### Iterator
> [!NOTE]
> Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### Mediator
> [!NOTE]
> Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

### Memento
> [!NOTE]
> Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that an object can be restored to its state.

### Observer
> [!NOTE]
> Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependants are notified and updated automatically.

### Prototype
> [!NOTE]
> Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

### Proxy
> [!NOTE]
> Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Singleton
> [!NOTE]
> Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

### State
> [!NOTE]
> Allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

### Strategy
> [!NOTE]
> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Template Method
> [!NOTE]
> Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

### Visitor
> [!NOTE]
> Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
